# Discussing the Significance of Union and Intersection Types in TypeScript

In TypeScript, these two types work based on the logic of arguments. In many cases, we need to assign parameters that can contain multiple types. For example, a function named `cow()` may require values that are a combination of `string`, `number`, `array`, or even `boolean`. In such cases, we must declare a type that is not a single type, but a combination of types. This is where **Union** and **Intersection** types are used.
